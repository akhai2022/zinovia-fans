# Content and watermark disclaimer

## Watermark meaning

Derived image variants (e.g. grid, full) served by Zinovia-Fans may display a footer watermark with text such as **"Published on Zinovia-Fans"** (or "Posted via Zinovia-Fans").

- The watermark indicates **platform origin only** — i.e. that the content was published or distributed via Zinovia-Fans.
- The watermark **does not** indicate certification, endorsement, or verification of the content by Zinovia-Fans.
- Original uploads are stored unchanged; the watermark is applied only to derived variants generated by the platform.

## Ownership and rights

- **Creators retain ownership** of their content. The presence of a watermark does not transfer any rights to Zinovia-Fans beyond the license granted under the terms of service.
- Zinovia-Fans does not claim ownership of user-uploaded content.

## Removal policy (optional)

If you are a rights holder and believe content should be removed, please contact support. Watermark removal from derived variants is handled as part of content removal; originals are not modified by the platform.
